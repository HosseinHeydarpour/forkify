// * Config.js is a js file to put the variables and values which are used multitple time across the prject for example the api URL is used for uplad/search and load recipe if this url changes and we dont have a config file we need to change that all over the project and that is so bad

// USING Upper case for a variable like this is a common practice because this variable is not going to change
